# Task Number 1:
## To-do List

## Problem Statement
A To-Do List application is a useful project that helps users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. This project aims to create a command-line or GUI-based application using Python, allowing users to create, update, and track their to-do lists.

## Code structure
This Python program utilizes the tkinter library to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) based To-do List application. The application allows users to manage tasks by adding, deleting, and viewing tasks, with tasks being stored in a "task.txt" file.

## Features:

- **Add Task:** Users can add tasks to the To-do List.
- **Delete Task:** Users can delete tasks from the To-do List.
- **View Tasks:** Users can view all tasks in the To-do List.

## File Handling:

The program utilizes the os library to check if the "task.txt" file exists. If the file does not exist, the program creates a new "task.txt" file to store tasks.

## Usage:

1. Run the Python program to launch the To-do List application.
2. Use the GUI interface to add, delete, and view tasks.

This application provides a simple and intuitive way for users to manage their tasks efficiently.

## How to Run
1. Ensure that you have python installed
2. Clone the task folder into your PC.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate the directory containing 'To-Do-List'.
5. Run the script using 'python To-Do-List' .
